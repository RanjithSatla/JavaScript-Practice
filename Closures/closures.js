///// CLOSURES ////

/* Closure : Closure is the closed-over variabale environment of the execution context, even after that execution context is gone.

2. A closure gives a function access to all the varibles of its parent function, even after that parent function has returned.The function keeps a refernce to its outer scope, which preserves the scope chain throughtout the time.

3. A closure makes sure that a function doesn't loose connection to variables existed at the functions birth place.

4. A closure is like a backpack that a function carries around whereever it goes. This backpack has all the variables that were present in the environment where the function was created.
